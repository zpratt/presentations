# Hello DevOps

## Dev and Ops ... Cats and Dogs?

There is a story to tell...

---

## Who Is Zach?

* Writing code since '98
* Started my career in '02 as a mainframe operator
* Employers: University -> Deere -> Hy-Vee -> TEK
* Career: Linux Sys Admin -> UI Developer -> Architect -> Technical Coach
  * some stuff in between

[More about me](https://github.com/zpratt/zpratt.github.io/blob/master/resume.md)

# TL;DR;

* True DevOps is not a practice, it's a culture.
* Tool and process expertise alone will not achieve the outcomes organizations are looking for.
* Engineers want a culture that celebrates experimentation, failure, inquiry, and learning.
* Maturity models miss the point.

---

# On to the story... In ye olden days

* Project Managers - gantt chart masters
* Business Analysts - big requirements up front
* Developers - type code as fast as possible
* Operations - figure out how to run it
* Architects - there's a visio for that

# Which led to

* Failure
* Blame
* Sleepless nights
* Power plays, political infighting
* Missed business opportunities

Pathological Culture. More on this later...

---

# We can do better

* agile (intentionally little "a")
* XP
* lean
* six sigma
* focus on outcomes (What and Why instead of How)

---

# And we hit the ceiling

We optimized for customer feedback, avoiding waste, and software engineering practices (TDD/BDD, SOLID, etc).

Meanwhile, our friends in operations were embracing ITIL, ticketing systems, and project management.

---

# Which led to

A chasm formed between product teams and operations.

We moved the constraint from how we build software to the way we deploy and run our systems.

---

# And we got a bit better

* Tools such as Build Servers (Hudson/Jenkins), Puppet and Virtualization started to gain adoption
* Operations analysts started writing code: **Ops -> Dev**
* Software engineers to started writing configuration and creating servers: **Dev -> Ops**

---

# And then... A Game changer

## The cloud!

* Democratized the creation and management of infrastructure
* Introduced APIs for creating and managing infrastructure
* Often adopted by developers to work around operations
* Shadow IT takes off!

---

# The in-between times of 2013 - 2017

* Startups: Co-located hosting and classic data centers are an anchor. Cloud only!
* Progressive behemoths: The cloud is a differentiator. Cloud first!
* Skeptics: Another entity will be operating our business critical systems? Cloud never!

---

# And we learned

* Devs: Creating servers is easy, securing and running them is hard.
* Ops: I'm going to be out of a job if I don't become a developer!
* Leaders: How do I measure our progress to justify investments?

---

# What about culture?

* Building systems is not the same as ditch digging.
* People are an asset, not a resource!
* Governance kills innovation.
* Scientific management yields babysitters.
* Metrics can be weaponized.

# Impact of culture

* With pathological management, outcomes will not be realized.
* Engineers want to be able to experiment and learn.
* Psychological safety is important. How does management become leadership?
* What about "the business"?

---

# Room to optimize

* Adopt lean to maximize opportunity
* Systems Thinking: Optimize with the whole system in mind
* Identify constraints: Value Stream Map
* Metrics focused on outcomes: [The 4 Key Metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance)

---

# What it's like today (tool fatigue)

* Infrastructure as code: Terraform, Cloudformation
* CI/CD: Jenkins, Drone, Circle CI, Concourse
* Polygot Programming: Javascript, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, Python, C#, etc...
* Microservices, Legacy Monoliths, [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/)
* Docker, Kubernetes, ECS
* Yaml, Yaml, Yaml
