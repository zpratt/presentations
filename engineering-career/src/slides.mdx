# Figure out how you learn.

## Why?

* Can you teach yourself, or do you need a mentor? Both?

## How?

* Seek out people you can pair with
* Be prepared to fail. Embrace failure
  * Develop your ability to turn unknown unknowns into known unknowns
  * Find ways to join the technical community
    * Ex: in the Des Moines area, there are user groups for javascript, c#, java, etc

# Identify where your areas of passion are

## Why?

* Embedded engineering?
* Site reliability?
* AI?
* Game developer?
* Web apps?
* Mobile apps?
* Can you combine a one or two of these with a passion that is also customer focused?
  * For me, this was agriculture, which is what drew me to Deere
  * You differentiate yourself when you can combine technical expertise with the ability to create customer solutions.

# Be prepared for change

## Why?
* It's difficult to tie your entire career to one tech stack, unless it's a niche (ex: COBOL).
* The best opportunities in your career will come from when you recognize a pivot in the industry before the majority.
