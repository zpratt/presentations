# Engineering Career Survival Guide

Staying current in technology. Why?

In order to sustain a career, among other things, you'll have to stay current in technology. That is, unless, [you're
planning to be a COBOL developer](https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/).

What about thriving?

# How did my career start?

* Discovered web development when I was 13 ([in ancient times](https://web.archive.org/web/19980210175524/http://www.yahoo.com/))
* Started as a mainframe operator when I was 18
* Wrote COBOL for a few months for an internship...
* Became a linux sysadmin when I graduated with my undergrad

### Figure out how you learn.

* Things change fast and new skills are required all the time.
* Teams go through changes, companies do as well.
* It's common for teams to make big technology pivots.

---

### Examples

* Companies decide they should go to the cloud and decide to have all teams manage their own infra.
* A team is asked to own different parts of the system, combining web applications and embedded systems.

---

### How?

* Can you teach yourself, or do you need a mentor? Both?
* Seek out people you can pair with
* Be prepared to fail. Embrace failure
* Develop your ability to turn unknown unknowns into known unknowns
* Find ways to join the technical community
  * Ex: in the Des Moines area, there are user groups for javascript, c#, java, etc

---

### Identify where your areas of passion are

* Embedded engineering? Site reliability? AI? Game developer? Web apps? Mobile apps?
* Can you combine a one or two of these with a passion that is also customer focused?
  * You differentiate yourself when you can combine technical expertise with the ability to create customer solutions.

---

# Be prepared for change

* It's difficult to tie your entire career to one tech stack, unless it's a niche (ex: COBOL).
* The best opportunities in your career will come from when you recognize a pivot in the industry before the majority.

# Maintain balance in your life. Don't burn yourself out
